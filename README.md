# **Project Overview**

  

This React-based application is designed to streamline task management in a user-friendly and efficient manner. The project focuses on providing users with an intuitive to-do list interface, allowing them to add, categorize, complete, and delete tasks seamlessly. It leverages modern web development practices and is built with scalability and maintainability in mind.

  

The app supports filtering tasks by categories such as “Work,” “Personal,” and “Urgent,” offering users the flexibility to organize their tasks effectively. Completed tasks can also be filtered separately for easy tracking. All tasks are stored in session storage, ensuring that the application retains its state across sessions without requiring a backend.

  

This project highlights core React concepts such as state management, component-based architecture, and the use of useEffect for side effects like session storage integration. The application is a perfect demonstration of how React can be used to build dynamic, responsive, and efficient single-page applications.

# **UI**

  

The UI emphasizes functionality and simplicity. The design is clean and minimalist, ensuring a distraction-free experience for users. Tasks are displayed in a well-structured list, with options to add, mark as completed, delete, or filter tasks by category. Buttons and form inputs are styled to be intuitive, making navigation effortless for users. While the aesthetics are straightforward, the layout ensures a focus on usability and accessibility.

**Project Requirements**

  

• Build a web app using React.

• Use sessionStorage to persist application state.

• Ensure task filtering by categories and completion status.

• Implement user-friendly UI with interactive elements.

• Write a README (using Markdown) that documents the project, including:

•  The purpose of the project.

•  Technologies used.
